AUTOEXEC:

// What is an Autoexec?
An autoexec.cfg is quite literally an automatically executed config. A text file generated (or saved) by the user, that tells the game
which specificsettings the user would like to use while they play. 
Autoexec.cfg's (often referred to as configs, .cfg, fps configs, scripts, etc.) live in your \cfg\ directory for CSGO on your local machine.
It mary vary a bit per user, but generally speaking you'll want to place your
.cfg into:

-> C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg 

An autoexec, automatically executes a config file that can alter your game experience.
For some players this means simply showing the net_graph that displays client/server connections as well as frames per second.
How many times in-game has someone asked you "how do you show your FPS?". The fast answer is net_graph, but the longer answer
is to have your .cfg file handle it. Moving on, take a look at a few of the available options for changing your individual
in-game experience.

// useful Tipps for Autoexec user:
->  .cfg files in CSGo actually got a maximum filezize to 6000 bytesm all .cfg files above wont execute at all!!
->  You can hardcode the .cfg with "host_writeconfig" but you will overwrite your Deufault cfg than!!!

// How to manage multiple .cfg loads on CSGo startup:
-> create a own .cfg for all tweaks you do for example: fps.cfg, video.cfg, bindings.cfg, sound.cfg .... and so far
-> create a blank autoexec.cfg and add the execute command for each .cfg u wanna load.

## autoexec.cfg example for multi .cfg loads: ##
##                                            ##    If you start CSGO it execute your autoexec.cfg cause u added "+exec autoexec"
## clear                                      ##    to your launchoptions. in this cfg u tell CSGO to execute all other configs
## exec fps.cfg                               ##    without adding them all without "+exec bla.cfg" "+exec bla2.cfg" and so far!
## exec video.cfg                             ##    
## exec bindings.cfg                          ##    The echo is a smart way to get an simple text-output to your console after launch
## exec ...                                   ##    if u added "- console" to launchoptions the console pops-up instand after starting.
##                                            ##    So if you see your text "configs loaded" in the console u now it worked!
##                                            ##
## echo " "                                   ##    For some bug fixing u can also add an echo line in each cfg so you see if any csf not
## echo "configs loaded"                      ##    loaded sucessfully!
## echo " "                                   ##
